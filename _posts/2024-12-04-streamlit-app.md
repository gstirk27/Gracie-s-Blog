### Introduction

One of my favorite video game series has been the Legend of Zelda series. It's a fantasy series that depicts many NPCs (non-playable characters) with different races and cultures. I thought it would be interesting to look at the demographics of each race in Hyrule (the fantasy kingdom where the games take place) to see which races make up the majority and how those majorities change between the different games. 

In my last [post](https://gstirk27.github.io/My-Blog/2024/11/06/curated-API.html), I got some data from [`the Legend of Zelda API`](https://docs.zelda.fanapis.com/) and used some Exploratory Data Analysis techniques to find out if there are any particularly interesting insights that I could glean from the data. In this post, we will look further into these insights using a streamlit app. The app I made for this post can be found [here](https://hyrule-census.streamlit.app/).
